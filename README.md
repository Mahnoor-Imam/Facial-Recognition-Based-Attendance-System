# Facial Recognition Based Attendance System

## Facial Recognition System
A facial recognition system is a technology capable of matching a human face from a digital image or a video frame against a database of faces and works by pinpointing and measuring facial features from a given image.

## Phases
1.	Face Detection
2.	Data Gathering
3.	Training the Recognizer
4.	Face Recognition
5.	Attendance System Integration

## Algorithm
### Haar Cascade Classifiers
It is an Object Detection Algorithm used to identify faces in an image or a real time video. The algorithm uses edge or line detection features proposed by Viola and Jones in their research paper “Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features” published in 2001. The algorithm is given a lot of positive images consisting of faces, and a lot of negative images not consisting of any face to train on them.

## Tools Used
* PyCharm IDE
* OpenCV Library
* GitHub Version Control
